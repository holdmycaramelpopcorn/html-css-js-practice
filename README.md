# html-css-js-practice
This is a repo that contains junk practice sessions pf when I tried to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript on Coursera. The course was by DukeUni and was practices on CodePen and the Duke Learn To Program (DLTP) interface.

The JS Code uses the DLTP libraries and a lot of functions are not in-built. For more details regarding these functions, visit http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/common/js/cs101/SimpleImage.js
